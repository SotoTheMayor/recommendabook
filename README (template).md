# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

We created this project to practice our skills in using server-side APIs, CSS frameworks, client-side storage, and more. We also used the project to practice working together as a team. Our app is designed to provide book recommendations in a fun way (book recs from cats!)
I (Hannah) learned how to use a new CSS framework, Tailwind CSS through this project.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
